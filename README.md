Zen Ghost Theme
==================================
### by Michael Genesini v.1.0.0

This is a porting of Ghost default theme Casper. Basically it is the same layout but based on Twitter Bootstrap with some other new features.
With Twitter Bootstrap integration user can edit basic layout of posts and static pages by adding divs with Bootstrap grid classes.

###Features:
	- Responsive menu for static pages
	- Twitter Bootstrap
	- Disqus
	- Search field to find posts
	- Pinterest Widget
	- And other in the future

For example to create a two column layout in your static page or in your post you simply add:
```html
<div class="col-md-6">
	First column content
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	Second column content
</div>
```

##### Note: this is a basic version of the theme, I will fix bugs and add more features as soon as possible.
